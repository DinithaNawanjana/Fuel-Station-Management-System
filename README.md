- **CRUD Operations**: Comprehensive data management for all modules.
- **Database Connectivity**: Efficient and secure database interactions.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging in `AdminFrame.java` to track system activities and admin actions.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files from the repository.
2. **Database Setup**: Configure the database connection in `DatabaseConnection.java`.
3. **Run the Application**: Start the application from `HomeView.java`.

## Logging Setup in AdminFrame.java
To set up logging in `AdminFrame.java`, the following steps were implemented:

1. **Import Logging Libraries**:
    ```java
    import java.util.logging.Logger;
    import java.util.logging.FileHandler;
    import java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter;
    ```

2. **Initialize Logger**:
    ```java
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(AdminFrame.class.getName());
    static {
        try {
            FileHandler fileHandler = new FileHandler("admin.log", true);
            fileHandler.setFormatter(new SimpleFormatter());
            logger.addHandler(fileHandler);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Log Admin Actions**:
    ```java
    public void someAdminAction() {
        logger.info("Admin performed an action");
        // Action code here
    }
    ```

## Future Enhancements
- **Detailed Error Handling**: Improve error handling mechanisms for better user experience.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Implement role-based access control to enhance security.
- **UI Enhancements**: Improve the user interface for a more intuitive experience.
